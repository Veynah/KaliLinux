# **Kali Linux - a Memo**
<h3>
This repo is for educationnal purposes only, it's me 're'reading Linux Basics for Hackers from Occupytheweb and making some notes and/or adding details and explanations for me, my friends or anyone reading this.<br>It's a great book that I'd recommand for anyone wanting to learn the basics of Linux (or the hacking journey)<br>
If I had any screenshot from the book, I'll make sure to explicitly say what page it's from and credit the author
</h3>
<h2>Let's BEGIN!</h2>
<p>First and foremost, we need to set up a VM(virtual machine) and install kali Linux on it.<br>
The "how to set up a VM" is not the goal of this repo so i'll just link some good tutorial for it but "what is" a VM is kinda more interesting.<br>
Here is a really good and detailed tutorial from NetworkChuck:<br> https://youtu.be/wX75Z-4MEoM?si=HX4IPh_E2KB5JrAP&t=425</p>

So, what is a Virtual Machine ?
