# **Kali Linux - a Memo**
<h3>
This repo is for educationnal purposes only, it's me 're'reading Linux Basics for Hackers from Occupytheweb and making some notes and/or adding details and explanations for me, my friends or anyone reading this.<br>It's a great book that I'd recommand for anyone wanting to learn the basics of Linux (or the hacking journey)<br>
If I had any screenshot from the book, I'll make sure to explicitly say what page it's from and credit the author

<h2>Let's BEGIN!</h2>
<p>First and foremost, we need to set up a VM(virtual machine) and install kali Linux on it.<br>
The "how to set up a VM" is not the goal of this repo so i'll just link some good tutorial for it but "what is a VM" is kinda more interesting.<br>
Here is a really good and detailed tutorial from NetworkChuck:<br> https://youtu.be/wX75Z-4MEoM?si=HX4IPh_E2KB5JrAP&t=425</p>

<h2>So, what is a Virtual Machine ?</h2>
A Virtual Machine (VM) is a software-based emulation of a computer system that runs on a physical machine. It provides the functionality of a physical computer and allows you to run multiple operating systems on a single piece of hardware.<br>

- **Host Operating System**: The original OS installed on your machine.<br>
- **Guest Operating System**: The OS running within the VM.<br>
- **Hypervisor**: The software that creates, runs, and manages VMs. Examples include VMware, VirtualBox, and Hyper-V.<br>

<h2>How do Virtual Machines operate ?</h2>
Virtual Machines operate by using a software layer called a "hypervisor" to emulate hardware resources. The hypervisor allocates these emulated hardware resources to each VM, making it possible to run multiple OS instances simultaneously.
